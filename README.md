# code_sample

Just some abstract Dart for review.

## Useful Information

The code in this repo has been abstracted from a working application, but there is no pubspec file with dependencies. It is NOT intended to be a working app, but merely to demonstrate the current development style with Flutter.

## Project architecture

The original project this code was abstracted from was built using:
* Bloc/Cubit State Management
* GraphQL queries and mutations with AWS
* Beamer for navigation
